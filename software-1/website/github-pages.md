# GitHub Pages

Facebook actually has documented all of the steps needed to completely deploy a React app on GitHub pages on their [deployment page](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).  Doing this would make the site accessible at `https://tjuav.github.io/site1/`.  We might want to change that using CNAME at some point.
