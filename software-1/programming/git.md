# Git

## Clone

To access any repositories, the first thing you need to do is clone them.

### Repository URL

To clone a repository, you will first need to get its clone URL. First, visit the repository page \(Example: `https://github.com/tj-uav/repo-name`\). Then, Click on the `Code` button, and copy the HTTPS URL.

### Cloning

To actually clone the repository, you will need to open either a Terminal or a Git Bash Console. Next, you should navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Here, you should run the following command, where &lt;url&gt; is the repository URL you copied from the previous step.

```text
git clone <url>
```

Now, the repository is succesfully cloned to your PC in your chosen directory.
