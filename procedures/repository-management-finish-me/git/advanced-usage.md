# Advanced Usage \(Need to complete branches\)

**Branches**

Branches are subdivisions of repos.

**Issues**

Issues are used to manage problems that are currently present in a repo. Issues can be about any problems with the repository, including changes in code structure, functionality that still needs to be implemented, or errors in code that need to be fixed. Issues can be created by anyone and assigned to anyone, but they can only be closed by admins.

**Pull Requests**

When you want to merge your branch's changes into master, you need to submit a pull request. A pull request entails that an admin will look through your code and make sure it is working and appropriate for the master branch \(it'll be used in the final competition code\). Pull requests will only be accepted if 1\) your code has been thoroughly tested, 2\) your code has been thoroughly documented, 3\) all issues relating to your code have been closed, and 4\) multiple people have reviewed your code.
