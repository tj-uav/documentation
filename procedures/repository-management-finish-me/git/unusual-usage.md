# Unusual usage

Git is kind of its own beast, and occasionally there'll be something that will be really difficult to understand.

### Octopus merging

> It's pulled, and it's fine, but there's clearly a balance between "octopus merges are fine" and "Christ, that's not an octopus, that's a Cthulhu merge".

Usually only two sources will be merged, and most people don't know this - you can actually merge as many branches as you want simultaneously in what's known as as an octopus merge. Through no such case currently exists in the current code base at time of writing there have been cases where it's almost made it in. And in case that's confusing, that's why this exists.

Fun fact: Octopus merging is no different than regular merging. Just go to that documentation!

 The above quote comes from Linus Torvalds, the creator of git after 66 branches were merged simultaneously after some edits were made in the ALSA library integrated into the Linux kernel.
