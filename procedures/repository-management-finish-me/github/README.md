# GitHub

#### Repository Location

All repositories are part of the tj-uav GitHub organization. If you don't know what this is or do not have access, have a member of TJUAV add you.

#### How we use GitHub \(Assuming no prior knowledge\)

GitHub is a platform for Git, which is a Version Control management system. This allows files to essentially be backed-up without keeping physical copies; changes are stored over the length of the repository so any code committed \(i.e. put in\) will be automatically backed up.

#### Git on Windows

Git comes by default on practically every operating system that we'll use \(or encounter, for that matter\), except Windows machines. Although multiple solutions exist, take a look at the[ Git Bash]() or [Cmder ]()solutions we have documented.
