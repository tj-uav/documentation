# New Member Guide

Hey there! Nice to know you joined the team, now get ready for some fun! You've probably just joined the team, and have already been blasted by questions and tasks to do. If so, don't worry, everyone is confused when they first get started. Hopefully this guide will help you get started and working on the fun stuff ASAP. Also feel free to scroll through GitBook to get yourself familiar with all the software, hardware, and procedures that we use, as well as documentation for anything you struggle with. Don't forget to add documentation on any problems you solve!

The team is mostly split into two subsystems, Mechanical and Programming. If you're unsure what you want to do, think about what you want to go into when you grow up, and what your passion is. Also you can do both mechanical and programming tasks, it's up to you, just let someone \(an officer or a lead\) know what subsystem you want to work on and they'll properly assign you a task.

## Subteams

### Mechanical

The Mechanical team is responsible for designing, building, and tweaking all of the hardware components on the plane, such as the fuselage, the wings, the UGV, and much more.

### Programming

The programming team focuses more on the software aspect of the competition, such as developing an obstacle avoidance algorithm, communicating with the plane during the flight, and developing a computer vision algorithm to autonomously detect and classify objects on the ground.

Don't worry! You're not going to be limited by the sub team you choose at all. Both the mech team and the programming team do a good amount of electronics, and also work together a lot.

## What you'll need

### Software

There is a lot of software that you will need throughout the year, and this varies depending on what sub-team you're on. However, for the best integration between all TJUAV members we highly encourage you download and get familiar with all of the software mentioned in this guide, because they are all crucial skills to learn. There is a guide on GitBook for each software on what it is used for and how to install it. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Almost everything we do _will_ work on a school laptop, but it's often such a hurdle to get working that we recommend getting your own personal computer if you don't have one.

* Fusion 360
* AutoCAD
* Matlab
* Mission Planner
* Visual Studio Code 
* Python 3 \(and all related packages\)
* Some sort of Linux shell \(this only applies if you're using Windows\)
  * I personally recommend WSL \(Windows subsystem for Linux\) because of it's convenience and ease of use. Other options if WSL isn't an option include Cmder, a Virtual Machine, and dual booting.

### Topics

Now this is a really broad section since the topics you should learn / get familiar with largely depend on what subsystem you're doing, and what tasks in specific you're focusing on.

**Flight Aerodynamics**

Obviously it's UAV club; if you don't wanna learn about planes, then you don't belong here. Planes are really cool, and so is physics, I shouldn't have to convince you to learn about this.

**Linux shell**

This one applies to programmers. Linux terminal programming is an extremely useful skill, and is an incredibly powerful tool when going into anything CS related. We also use a variety of hardware that runs Linux, such as the Raspberry Pi and the Jetson TX2, so it's recommended you learn how to work with a Linux shell so that you can interact with our hardware.

**Python**

Once again, this applies mainly to programmers, though everyone is encouraged to learn Python because of how useful it is in to engineers as a whole. This is especially because Python is easy to learn, and learning Python makes learning other languages or understanding code a whole lot easier.

**Fusion 360**

This is targeted more for the mechanical subteam, but programmers are encouraged to learn it as well. We use Fusion 360 for all of our CAD here. We also have a team subspace in Fusion 360, so be sure to talk to the mechanical team lead to get added. Once you have everything installed and ready to go, I'd advise you to look into some tutorials about Fusion 360 and all of the awesome features it has.

{% hint style="warning" %}
 Do **not** purchase a license for Fusion! You can get a free version with your tjhsst.edu email.
{% endhint %}

**A note about working in shared spaces**

The tools of our modern era have given us the ability to store our work online in services like GitHub, fusion, and even here in GitBook. Anytime that you are working in one of these environments, please save your work _regularly_. If you forget to save, your work might be lost, or you may end up overriding someone else's work once you do save. For the most part, your team lead\(s\) should be assigning you individual work so projects shouldn't overlap on the same files, but accidents happen.
