# New Member Guide

Hey there! Nice to know you joined the team, now get ready for some fun! You've probably just joined the team, and have already been blasted by questions and tasks to do. If so, don't worry, everyone is confused when they first get started. Hopefully this guide will help you get started and working on the fun stuff ASAP. Also feel free to scroll through GitBook to get yourself familiar with all the software, hardware, and procedures that we use, as well as documentation for anything you struggle with. Don't forget to add documentation on any problems you solve!

The team is mostly split into two subsystems, Mechanical and Programming. If you're unsure what you want to do, think about what you want to go into when you grow up, and what your passion is. Also you can do both mechanical and programming tasks, it's up to you, just let someone \(an officer or a lead\) know what you want subsystem you want to work on and they'll properly assign you a task.

## Subteams

### Mechanical

The Mechanical team is responsible for designing, building, and tweaking all of the hardware components on the plane, such as the fuselage, the wings, the UGV, and much more.

### Programming

The programming team focuses more on the software aspect of the competition, such as developing an obstacle avoidance algorithm, communicating with the plane during the flight, and developing a computer vision algorithm to autonomously detect and classify objects on the ground.

Don't worry! You're not going to be limited by the subteam you choose at all. Both the mech team and the programming team do a good amount of electronics, and also work together a lot.

## What you'll need

### Software

There is a lot of software that you will need throughout the year, and this varies depending on what subteam you're on. However, I highly encourage you download and get familiar with all of the software that I mention in this guide, because they are all crucial skills to learn. There is a guide on GitBook for each software on what it is used for and how to install it. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PERSONAL LAPTOP THAT YOU CAN BRING TO MEETINGS, GET ONE!

* Fusion 360
* AutoCAD
* Matlab
* Mission Planner
* Vscode
* Python \(and all related packages\)
* Some sort of Linux shell \(this only applies if you're using Windows\)
  * I personally recommend WSL \(Windows subsystem for Linux\) because of it's convenience and ease of use. Other options include Cmder, using a Virtual Machine, and dual booting.

### Topics

Now this is a really broad section since the topics you should learn / get familiar with largely depend on what subsystem you're doing, and what tasks in specific you're focusing on.

**Flight Aerodynamics**

Obviously it's UAV club; if you don't wanna learn about planes, then you don't belong here. Planes are really cool, and so is physics, I shouldn't have to convince you to learn about this.

**Linux shell**

Okay this one applies to programmers. Linux terminal programming is an EXTREMELY useful skill, trust me you won't regret learning it if you go into anything CS related. We also use a variety of hardware that runs Linux, such as the RPi and the Jetson TX2, so it's recommended you learn how to work with a Linux shell.

**Python**

Once again, this applies mainly to programmers, although I encourage everyone to learn Python because of how useful it is in to engineers as a whole. This is especially because Python is easy to learn, and learning Python makes learning other languages or understanding code a whole lot easier.
