# GitBook

Most important thing:

### DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.

TJUAV requires all member's work must be documented in some way or form. This includes the following:

1. Code in GitHub must be fully documented before it can be merged to `master`.
2. Any major branch \(with significant work\) in a repository should have it's own documentation.
3. Finalized parts and designs potentially or for actual use during any flights.
4. Operational procedures. If the procedure isn't on GitBook, we almost certainly can't do it in the competition or critical flights.
