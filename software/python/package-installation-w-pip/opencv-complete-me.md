description: Python 3 OpenCV Installation
---

# OpenCV \(complete me!\)

## Windows

Download by following the instructions here: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

Or, run the following command in your terminal

```
pip install opencv-python
```

## Linux / MacOS

If you are using a Linux or Mac operating system, it's recommended that you install opencv using your OS's package manager. For example on Ubuntu, this would be sudo apt install python3-opencv.

## Installation Test

Once installed use OpenCV in your Python programs by importing it using: 

`import cv2`

The following line should result in no errors, and if it does, then please let someone know. To check your openCV version, type the following command: 

```text
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)
```

The team currently uses openCV version 4.1.1. If your version is outdated, try upgrading it, and if you are unable to do so by yourself, let someone know.
