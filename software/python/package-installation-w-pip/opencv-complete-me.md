Download by following the instructions here: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

Or, run the following command in your terminal

```
pip install opencv-python Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.

Once installed use OpenCV in your Python programs by importing it using:
