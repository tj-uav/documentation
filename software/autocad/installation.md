# Installation

## Registration

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not already have one, register an Autodesk account before starting this step. It's the same as getting an account anywhere else.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
AutoCAD supports only Windows and OS X. Unfortunately, it does not currently support Linux & BSD distributions.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
AutoCAD can not be installed on FCPSOn devices, as it requires administrative installation. Not that you would want to; the devices don't technically support the minimum requirements anyways.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to [Educational Free Trial](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/autocad) for AutoCAD from the [Free Trial](https://www.autodesk.com/free-trials) page
2. Sign in to your Autodesk account and follow the instructions onscreen to obtain your license/download the installer.
3. Install as you would any other software.
4. Once the software loads, sign in using the button in the upper right corner.

{% hint style="success" %}
AutoCAD should now be installed.
{% endhint %}
