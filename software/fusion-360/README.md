# Fusion 360

**Fusion 360** is a cloud-based Computer Aided Design tool for collaborative product development that combines industrial design and mechanical engineering. Fusion 360 is much better than another CADDing software, Solidworks. If solidworks is currently installed on your computer, the smartest decision would be to buy a new comupter.
