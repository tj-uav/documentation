# Installation

## Registration

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not already have one, register an Autodesk account before starting this step. It's the same as getting an account anywhere else.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Fusion 360 supports only Windows and OS X. Unfortunately, it does not currently support Linux & BSD distributions.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Fusion 360 can not be installed on FCPSOn devices, as Fusion requires administrative installation. Not that you would want to; the devices don't technically support the minimum requirements anyways.
{% endhint %}
