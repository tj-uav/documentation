# Getting Started

When you first get Cura, you'll be asked to add a printer. Choosing the printer does not matter as long as you set up the size dimensions of the build volume based on specifications you can find online. \(my Ender Pro 3 is 220mm\*220mm\*250mm\)

![Those three lines allow you to set the &quot;difficulty&quot; of Cura. I generally use Expert or All even though I am not qualified for either. ](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2836%29.png)

Now, I'll walk you through the tabs and tell you the important stuff in the coming pages.
