You just have to click "Generate Support" and then play around with the first 3 settings.

**Support Overhang Angle:** if the angle between layers is greater than this it will generate supports. This is measured from the normal \(vertical\).

**Support Pattern:** Zig Zag is very good for easily removable supports. Under the Experimental Tab, Tree Support is very good for easy to remove, lightweight, quick supports.
