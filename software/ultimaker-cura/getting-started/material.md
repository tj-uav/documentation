Temperature depends on your FILAMENT BRAND, not your plastic type. Check the package carefully for the temperature range and pick a number in the middle. PLA tends to run around 200C while ABS is around 245C. 

The build plate temperature for PLA is around 60C and around 110C for ABS.

Don't mess with the flow rate until you are so proficient with the 3D printer that you know more than this tutorial.
