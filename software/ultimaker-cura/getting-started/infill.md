**Infill Density:** 20% is standard, 50% is pretty strong and heavy, 75-80% is virtually fully filled \(Note! 100% infill is a no-no because it overfills your print and causes it to warp!\)

**Infill Pattern:** Different patterns have different strengths and weaknesses \(I prefer Gyroid because of its strength in virtually every direction\)
