**Layer Height:** A smaller layer height is a fine print, but it takes longer! \(I stick to the default options generally that are found in the dropdown right above this one labeled "Profiles"\)

Initial Layer Height: I've found no reason to mess with this, but it may help with adhesion for some people.

**Line Width \(and subsettings\):** Normally the width of your nozzle. \(I've never found a reason to play with this either.\)
