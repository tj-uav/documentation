# Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
Cmder is only for Windows devices. If you prefer to use Powershell, feel free to use that instead. TJUAV recommends learning basic bash \(The typical terminal system in \*nix systems\). 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
We strongly recommend getting the full version, as all instructions assume that version. In addition, the lite version is known to often not work on FCPSOn devices entirely.
{% endhint %}

1. Download Cmder [here](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.12/cmder.zip).
2. Extract to your install location to install.
3. Run, and right click on the bottom bar to access, and click on the Settings option.
4. In the General settings that come up, locate "Choose your startup task..." Set the next dropdown to `{bash::bash}`.

{% hint style="success" %}
Cmder should now be fully installed \(and set up\).
