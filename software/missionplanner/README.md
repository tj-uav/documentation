# MissionPlanner

Mission Planner is used by the team for a variety of tasks, such as controlling the plane autonomously, controlling the UGV autonomously, switching the mode the plane is currently in, and controlling the Antenna Tracker. Mission Planner is somewhat of a headache to use, so hopefully the documentation will help you figure out how to use it. If you figure out anything new related to MP, make sure to document it!

Mission planner is our ground-station software. To download it, google Mission Planner \(only for Windows\) and follow downloading instructions from there.

Once in mission planner, you have to connect your vehicle.

Connecting a vehicle:

1. In the top left, choose the port to connect to
2. For telemetry connections, choose the baud rate of 57600. For wired connections, choose 9600. Failing to do so will result in a failed connect.
3. Click connect.
4. If the connect fails, that means your telemetry is not operating correctly \(flashing green light means not connected, flashing red means transmitting, solid green means connected, no red light means not transmitting, if no lights are present you forgot to plug it in\)

Mission Planner tabs:

1. Flight Screen: contains all the data about the flight
2. Flight Plan: where you make and edit missions
3. Setup: where all calibrations are made
4. Config/Tuning: for tuning \(only use this after you get something working\)
