# MissionPlanner

Mission planner is our ground-station software. To download it, google Mission Planner \(only for Windows\) and follow downloading instructions from there.

Once in mission planner, you have to connect your vehicle.

Connecting a vehicle:

1. In the top left, choose the port to connect to
2. For telemetry connections, choose the baud rate of 57600. For wired connections, choose 9600. Failing to do so will result in a failed connect.
3. Click connect.
4. If the connect fails, that means your telemetry is not operating correctly \(flashing green light means not connected, flashing red means transmitting, solid green means connected, no red light means not transmitting, if no lights are present you forgot to plug it in\)
