# Installation

For all operating systems, feel free to download all the packages you are permitted to under the education licence, for once you download it the software is forever in your possession. For some reason Matlab, once installed, continues to work even when the license expires. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
For Linux users, see the Linux install instructions for your particular distribution before continuing, for some instructions may very slightly.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
No installation procedure has been determined for FCPSOn devices. Do not attempt.

&lt;Add something about registration \(school email, etc\), and actually heading to the downloads page&gt;

### Windows

Install Matlab as you would any other software, following the instructions of the prompt.

### Mac

Install Matlab as you would any other software, following the instructions of the prompt.

### Linux

Installation instructions differ greatly between distributions. However, those that have been successfully installed by at least one member of the club are listed as follows:

#### Ubuntu Linux \(+Derivatives\)

Matlab natively supports Ubuntu Linux and it's derivatives. Simply run the installer as root provided on their website: `sudo ./install`. It may be necessary to run `sudo apt-get install matlab-support`, and run `sudo chown username -R ~/.matlab` if you wish to be able to run Matlab without root access.

More information can be obtained [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB). This guide is for an older version, but has been tested to work with the latest releases.

#### Arch

The [matlab](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/matlab/)$$^{{AUR}}$$ package can be used to facilitate the install of Matlab. However, it is strongly recommended to look at [the wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MATLAB#Installing_from_the_MATLAB_installation_software) for advanced configuration.
