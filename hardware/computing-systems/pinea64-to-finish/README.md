# PineA64

The PineA64 is a SoC \(System-on-Chip\) based on the ARM64 architecture, making it one of the first board to be in this architecture. It is occasionally used by some TJUAV member to test architecture specfic issues that may also occur in the [TX2](../nvidia-jetson-tx2-to-finish/).

It is similar in CPU performance to a Raspberry Pi 3B+; however is lacking in the GPU and wireless networking department. More information can be found [here](https://www.pine64.org/devices/single-board-computers/pine-a64/).
