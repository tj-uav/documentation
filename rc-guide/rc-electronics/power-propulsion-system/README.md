# Power / Propulsion System

The Power/Propulsion system encapsulates all of the electronics on the plane. This system is how the electronics work together to power the plane, and generate thrust. As a general overview, these electronics are powered by the flow of electrons \(electricity\). When it comes to electricity, there are three important aspects: voltage, amperage, and resistance.
