# Power / Propulsion System

The Power/Propulsion system encapsulates all of the electronics on the plane. It is important to know how this system works because it utilizes the all of the electronics components on the plane to generate thrust.

**Electronics Overview:**

As a general overview, the electronics on the plane are powered by the flow of electrons \(electricity\). When it comes to electricity, there are three important aspects: voltage, amperage, and resistance. Let's briefly go over each.
