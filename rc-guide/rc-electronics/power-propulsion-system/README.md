# Power / Propulsion System

The Power/Propulsion system encapsulates all of the electronics on the plane. It is important to know how this system works because it utilizes the electronics components to generate thrust and power the plane.

**Electronics Overview:**

As a general overview, the electronics on the plane are powered by the flow of electrons \(electricity\). When it comes to electricity, there are three important aspects: voltage, current, and resistance. Let's briefly go over each.

Voltage, measured in volts \(V\), is the pushing force behind the electrons. When voltage is applied to a stream of electrons, it will cause the electrons to flow from the higher to lower voltage area. For example, electrons flow from the positive \(5V, 12V, 24V, etc.\) side of a battery to the negative end \(0V\).

Current, measured in amperes \(amps\), is the measure of the number of electrons moving through a given area per second \(or more broadly, the net rate of flow of electrons through a given space\).
