  The Power/Propulsion system encapsulates all of the electronics on the plane.
  This system is how the electronics work together to power the plane and
  generate thrust.

# Power / Propulsion System

As a general overview, the electronics on the plane are powered by the flow of electrons \(electricity\). When it comes to electricity, there are three important aspects: voltage, amperage, and resistance.
