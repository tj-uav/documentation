# Aerodynamics

Aerodynamics is the study of how air interacts with solid objects \(such as an RC airplane\) moving through it. 

It's important to know basic aerodynamics because planes utilize the air around them to generate lift and maneuver using control surfaces. Additionally, aerodynamic concepts are responsible for two of the four forces acting on your plane which are drag and lift.
