# Aerodynamics

Aerodynamics is the study of how air interacts with solid objects \(such as an RC airplane\) moving through it. 

It's important to know basic aerodynamics because planes utilize the air around them to generate lift and maneuver using control surfaces. 

**How lift is generated by the wings:**

Most RC planes have airfoils that have curvature on top and a flat bottom surface. As the wing moves through the air, the curvature of the airfoil means that the area behind the airfoil
