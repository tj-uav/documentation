# CW and CCW Propellers

You can tell if a propeller is CW or CCW simply by looking at the elevated ridges of the propeller. If the elevated ridge is on the left side it is a clockwise prop and it is a counter-clockwise prop if the elevated ridge is on the right. If you think about how the propeller will displace the air/pull the air,  you are going to turn in the direction of the elevated ridge.
