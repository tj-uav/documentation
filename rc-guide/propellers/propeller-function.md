description: Function of Propellers and How they work

# Function

The idea of propellers follows newton's third law of: "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction". Propellers are built in such a way where when they start rotating, they are displacing the air and pulling it behind them. This action results in what we call thrust, and move the propeller/plane forward. \(just like newton 's third law\). The more pulled air will result in more thrust which in turn means the plane will speed up. The number of blades on the propeller can also be changed based on the power of the engine. If the engine is a lot stronger, there may be a need for more propeller blades to produce more thrust they carry a heavier plane \(Think of a jet engine propeller\).
