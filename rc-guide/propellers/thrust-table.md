# Thrust Table

A Thrust table hold lots of information such as the amount of voltage, amps, watts, RPM, Temperature of the motor, thrust, throttle, and Propeller size.  A thrust table is used to determine which motor is best for your plane. \(More info in the motor section\). It can also be used to determine what kind of propeller should be used to accommodate the motor based on its efficiency and and the amount of thrust produced.
