# A\*

## **Background**

A\* is what is known as an informed search algorithm. There are different types of these algorithms, but their overall purpose is the same. To find the best path between a start and end point while given a set of restrictions and/or conditions.

These conditions can include:

* Obstacles in which the path cannot intersect
* Certain points that must be reached in a certain order before the goal
* A maximum angle at which the path is allowed to turn

All of these conditions are those used in our own A\* code, where we attempt to find the best and shortest path between each waypoint while avoiding given obstacles.
