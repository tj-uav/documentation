# RRT and RRT\*

## Background

RRT, or Rapidly-exploring Random Tree, is another type of search algorithm much like A\*. RRT can be either a completely randomized or an informed search, in which case it is called RRT\*. The primary difference between A\* and RRT is the method through which neighbors and found and added.
