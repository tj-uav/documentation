# Drop Mechanism

The current idea for the drop mechanism is to use a linear actuator to open up a hatch underneath the plane, from which the UGV will drop. The hatch will then snap back up with magnets when the wind pushes it up. We have not started developing code for actuating the drop mechanism,  but if you're trying to do just that, look into actuating a linear actuator in python using a Jetson TX2.
