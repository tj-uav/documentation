# Drop Timing Algorithm

Currently there is no algorithm in place to determine the optimal time to release the UGV. This will require a lot of calculations as well as simulations to figure out an optimal algorithm. Here are some things to consider for the algorithm:

* Ground speed and direction of the plane
* Speed and direction of the wind
* UGV drop actuation time
* UGV mid-flight dynamics \(drag, terminal velocity, etc.\)
